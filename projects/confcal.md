title: Multivariate Confidence Calibration for Object Detection
date: 2020
labels:
  - Neural Networks
  - Uncertainty Calibration
summary: We present a novel framework to measure and calibrate biased (or miscalibrated) confidence estimates of object detection methods. The main difference to related work in the field of classifier calibration is that we also use additional information of the regression output of an object detector for calibration. Our approach allows, for the first time, to obtain calibrated confidence estimates with respect to image location and box scale.
