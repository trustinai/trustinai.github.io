title: Parametric and Multivariate Uncertainty Calibration for Regression and Object Detection
date: 2022
labels:
  - Neural Networks
  - Uncertainty Calibration
  - Regression Calibration
summary: We inspect the calibration properties of common detection networks and extend state-of-the-art recalibration methods. Our methods use a Gaussian process (GP) recalibration scheme that yields parametric distributions as output (e.g. Gaussian or Cauchy). The usage of GP recalibration allows for a local (conditional) uncertainty calibration by capturing dependencies between neighboring samples.
