title: The Gaussian Discriminant Variational Autoencoder: A Self-Explainable Model with Counterfactual Explanations
date: 2024
labels:
  - Self-explainable Model
  - Counterfactual Explanation
  - Manifold Traversal
  - Generative Models
  - Variational Autoencoder
summary: We introduce the GdVAE, a self-explainable model that employs transparent prototypes in a white-box classifier. Alongside class predictions, we provide counterfactual explanations.
