title: Bayesian Confidence Calibration for Epistemic Uncertainty Modelling
date: 2021

summary: We introduce Bayesian confidence calibration - a framework to obtain calibrated confidence estimates in conjunction with an uncertainty of the calibration method. We use stochastic variational inference to build a calibration mapping that outputs a probability distribution rather than a single calibrated estimate. Using this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art calibration performance for object detection calibration.
